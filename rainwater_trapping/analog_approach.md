Analog Water Trapping (Continuous)

In analog version, the elevation is represented by a function f(x).

Steps:
1. Sample f(x) at fine intervals (dx = 0.01).
2. Store sampled heights.
3. Apply same logic as discrete version.
4. Integrate the trapped area under the curve using numerical methods.

Example:
- f(x) = sin(x), from x = 0 to Ï€
- Sample, compare local mins/maxs
- Estimate trapped water using summation or trapezoidal rule
