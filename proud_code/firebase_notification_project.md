Firebase Notification System (React + Firebase)

I built a real-time notification system using Firebase Firestore and React.

Key Features:
- React app with Redux
- Firestore real-time listeners
- Unread badge + toast alerts
- Firebase Cloud Functions for email

Challenges:
- Managing Firestore listeners efficiently
- Handling read/unread status

Why Iâ€™m Proud:
It helped me understand real-time architecture and improved my skills in cloud functions and user experience design.
